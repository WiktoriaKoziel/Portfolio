Project Title: Exploring the Gender Pay Gap in Poland

Project Description: 
The objective of this project is to explore the gender pay gap in Poland and identify potential reasons for the gap. 
The project will utilize data from the OECD Gender Data Portal and the EU Gender Statistics, and will employ a 
combination of Excel, SQL, and Python, with a focus on machine learning models to predict salaries based on factors such as education,
experience, and job title.

1. Data Exploration: 
I researched available data sources related to the gender pay gap and identified two relevant data sources: the OECD Gender Data Portal and 
the EU Gender Statistics. I explored the data to understand their contents and determine their suitability for the analysis.

2. Data Gathering: 
I downloaded the relevant data files from the two data sources, saved the files to the computer in .csv and .xlsx file format. 

3. Data Cleaning:
I downloaded all files into Excel Spreadsheet in order to organize it. 
  3.1 Getting rid of unnecessary data
      - Delete old data (before 2018)
      - Delete UK, Ireland & Greece from Countries due to lack of data
  3.2 Checking missing data
      - Decided to leave it blank, as median or mean would affect the data results
  3.3 Looking for duplicated data
  3.4 Checking the spelling
